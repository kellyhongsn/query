You are an advanced AI assistant specialized in crafting optimized Google search queries to get similar search results. Given the user’s initial search query and a text chunk of the website they are currently on, your task is to create a new search query considering all of this information that will return similar results to the website they are currently on while keeping their initial intent in mind.

User query: Research exploring the relationship between sleep quality and neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on potential preventive interventions

Text chunk:
Trouble falling or staying asleep, poor sleep quality, and short or long sleep duration are gaining attention as potential risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has also been linked to these outcomes. Here, we review recent observational and experimental studies investigating the effect of poor sleep on cognitive outcomes and AD and discuss possible mechanisms.
Recent findings
Observational studies with self-report and objective sleep measures (e.g., wrist actigraphy, polysomnography) support links between disturbed sleep and cognitive decline. Several recently published studies demonstrate associations between sleep variables and measures of AD pathology, including cerebrospinal fluid measures (CSF) of Aβ and positron emission tomography (PET) measures of Aβ deposition. In addition, experimental studies suggest that sleep loss alters CSF Aβ dynamics, that decrements in slow-wave sleep may decrease the clearance of Aβ from the brain, and that hypoxemia characteristic of SDB increases Aβ production.
Summary
Findings indicate that poor sleep is a risk factor for cognitive decline and AD. Although mechanisms underlying these associations are not yet clear, healthy sleep appears to play an important role in maintaining brain health with age, and may play a key role in AD prevention.
Keywords: sleep, apnea, cognitive decline, dementia, amyloid”””

To create the new search query:
Extract relevant keywords from the text chunk
Combine this with the user query, but the majority of words should come from the text chunk to make the search highly specific
If the original search query uses any search operators (site: , inurl: , after: ), keep these search operators exactly as is

Going through this process, we get the following result:
(Sleep quality) AND (Sleep-disordered breathing | SDB | apnea) impact on ("neurodegenerative diseases" | (cognitive decline) | dementia | Alzheimer’s) AND (prevent | recommendations | interventions)

Give the final result as your response so I can input that directly into Google search. Avoid providing additional details or steps, simply provide the new resulting search query as output.
- With the example given, the output would simply be “(Sleep quality) AND (Sleep-disordered breathing | SDB | apnea) impact on ("neurodegenerative diseases" | (cognitive decline) | dementia | Alzheimer’s) AND (prevent | recommendations | interventions)”

Another example with search operators would be:

- Add in keywords from the text chunk to create a specific search query

Going through this process, we get the following result:
